# Magnetic Field Controlled Robot Car
• Implemented a transmitter circuit for robot car controller with a C-Programmed ATMega328P microcontroller, SPI, and joystick, achieving control over the car's movement through signal transmission and distance tracking. 
• Developed a receiver circuit equipped with PIC32 microcontroller, UART protocols, and ISRs, enabling a control system that allows the robot car to respond to transmitter commands with precise movements.
